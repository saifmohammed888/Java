Java is a Object oriented programming with following Features:

	- Robust
	- Secure, portable
	- Simple and verbose
	- Platform Independent 
	- No pointers concepts
	- It follows and object oriented model
	- Java 12 is the latest version of java as we work on this today.
	
Applications of Java

	1. Web Applications
	2. Enterprise Applications or Api's
	3. Embedded systems.
	4. Scientific Applications
	5. Big data technologies, kafka components
	6. IOT - smart watches, cars, sensors.
	
JVM - Java virtual machine

	1. Java virtual machine is a vm provided by java that generates java bytecode.
	2. JDK - used to develop code, complile and run hence it is jre plus jvm.
	
Steps How java works.
	-> Developer writes and compiles code to generate .java file
	-> The JVM then generates the bytecode and gives it to the interpreter.
	-> The Java interpreter then comverts bytecode to machine code to give the output.
	
First Java program 
	-> The compiler executing the code from main method.
	-> The main method is executed first as we make it static.
	
Java Fundamentals

1. Access Modifiers
	
	a. Default 	- Data is accessible only within the package
	b. Private 	- Data is accessible only within a class
	c. Public  	- Data is accessible from anywhere in the project
	d. Protected	- Data is accessible from class, its sub classes inside a package.
	
2. Non Access Modifiers

	a. static		-Helps in calling methods without object - loaded before main
	b. Final		-The value of the data with final keyword cannot be changed.
	c. Abstract		-Classes or methods having just declaration but no implementation.
	d. Synchronized		-Threading concepts

3. Variable	- Variables are memory location reserved to store values,there are 3 types of variables.

	a. Local 		- Variable storing data for each method or class.
	b. Instance 	- Variable storing data for each object that we create
	c. Static		- Variable storing data for each class that we create.
