JVM - Java virtual machine

	1. Java virtual machine is a vm provided by java that generates java bytecode.
	2. JDK - used to develop code, complile and run hence it is jre plus jvm.
	
	
Steps How java works.
	-> Developer writes and compiles code to generate .java file
	-> The JVM then generates the bytecode and gives it to the interpreter.
	-> The Java interpreter then comverts bytecode to machine code to give the output.
	
First Java program 
	-> The compiler executing the code from main method.
	-> The main method is executed first as we make it static.
